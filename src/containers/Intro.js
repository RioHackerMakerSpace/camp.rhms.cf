            <h3><strong>Declarative Programming</strong><br />Conference and Summer School</h3>

            <p>Declarative programming is an advanced paradigm for modeling and solving complex problems. This method has attracted increased attention over the last decades, e.g., in the domains of data and knowledge engineering, databases, artificial intelligence,
                natural language processing, modeling and processing combinatorial problems, and for establishing systems for the web.
            </p>
            <p>The conference Declare 2017 aims to promote the cross-fertilizing exchange of ideas and experiences among researches and students from the different communities interested in the foundations, applications, and combinations of high-level, declarative
                programming and related areas.</p>

            <p>It will be accompanied by a one-week summer school on Advanced Concepts for Databases and Logic Programming for students and PhD students.</p>

            <p>The technical program of the event will include invited talks, presentations of refereed papers, and system demonstrations.</p>
